# Changes — 1.0.0-beta9

## Added
- **Per-string solar energy sensors** (integrated-MPPT models, e.g. Power Core):
  `Solar string 1/2/3 energy today` — daily kWh totals broken out per MPPT
  string, alongside the existing combined `Solar energy today` sensor (#20).
- Restored the **Battery Module N Serial** diagnostic sensors.

## Fixed
- **`Solar energy today` double-counting:** the daily total now sums only the
  three per-string columns of the `mppt-v2` series instead of also adding the
  pre-summed total and state columns.

## Notes
- The new per-string sensors are created only on models with integrated MPPT;
  they do not appear on Power Store (external solar).
